# 🛍️ Grabbit – Local Product Request & Response Platform

Grabbit is a real-time web platform that bridges the gap between local consumers and small businesses. Instead of browsing endless listings, users simply **post what they’re looking for**, and nearby shops respond if they have the item. It’s a demand-driven model that promotes unique products, supports local commerce, and simplifies the buying process for both sides.

## ✨ Key Features

### For Users:
- Post product requests with optional photos and urgency.
- View responses from nearby shops.
- Compare shop offers and ratings.
- Connect directly with shops through messages or calls.

### For Shops:
- View nearby product requests in real-time.
- Respond to users if the product is available.
- Build a reputation through user feedback and ratings.
- No need to upload full inventory—only respond when you have it.
